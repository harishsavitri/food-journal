# food-journal
A browser-based meal tracking app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Lets users log meals by type (breakfast, lunch, dinner), view ingredient-level nutrition breakdowns, calculate daily totals, and visualize macronutrients with interactive charts using Chart.js. Data is stored locally for persistent tracking without a backend.
